# WaruSmart-EmbeddedApp-EnvironmentCollector-Physical
## Summary
WaruSmart-EmbeddedApp-EnvironmentCollector-Physical is the embedded software running on an ESP32 microcontroller, responsible for collecting environmental data from a capacitive soil moisture sensor (V2.0.0) and a DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor. It uses WiFi connectivity to send the sensor readings via HTTP to the Fog backend. The application is developed using the Arduino framework and relies on key libraries such as WiFi, DHT, and HTTPClient.
